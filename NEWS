CHANGES (0.43)
 
 * Enhancements:

   - If there are unsatisiefied dependencies show more details like
     apt-get does
   - Allow distributions to ship different lintian tag files (fatal and
     non-fatal ones) - adds a depedency on lsb_release
   - No longer take queued transactions into account to simulate
     transactions (future status). The multi arch support adds to much
     complexity.
   - Automatically switch to non-interactive mode if the controlling terminal
     of the client isn't available anymore
   - Verify package names specified in aptdaemon DBus calls

 * API changes:

   - aptdaemon.gtkwidgets.AptProgressDialog.run() is now deferable,
     LP #626798
 
 * Bug fixes:
   
   - Wait for the lock after dpkg has been executed instead of failing
     LP #698170, #665572
   - Don't overwrite DBusException.args in TransactionFailed leading to
     empty error messages
   - Fix policykit translations by dropping the gettext domain field from the
     policy definitions, LP #690270
   - Fix installing local packages which are not yet known to the cache
   - Fix use of required_version in the gt3widgets, thanks pitti
   - Fix the client add_repository call, thanks mvo
   - Stop processing a transaction in the client if there has been an error
   - Adapt gtkwidgets.AptProgressDialog.run() to latest API using
     the sync() method of the transaction
   - Call waitpid after reading the output from lintian, LP# 724859
   - Allow package names containing an architecture separated by ":",
     LP #750941
   - gtkwidgets.AptProgressDialog.run() should call Transaction.sync() if
     attach is True. Missing adoption to API changes.
   - Don't segfault if we cannot read the status of the process holding a
     lock - fixes LP #745517 
   - Fix UnicodeDecodeErrors, LP #724735, #745261, #742051, #749505, #707490,
     #707490, #708964, #747037 and #706572
   - Fix logging of Finished signals


CHANGES (0.42):

 - IMPORTANT SECURTIY FIX, see CVE-2011-0725
   http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2011-0725
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aptdaemon/+bug/722228
   
   The UpdateCachePartially method allows to specify an alternative
   sources.list snippet to only update the repositories specified in the
   corresponding configuration file.

   Aptdaemon did not restrict the path to the sources.list.d directory and
   allowed to inject packages from malicious sources specified in a custom
   sources.list and even to read every file on the system.


CHANGES (0.41):

 - Greatly enhanced test suite by moving to unittest2, allowing to perform
   package operations in a chroot and running tests on a local session dbus:
   "dbus-launch unit2 discover"
 - Improved error reporting
 - Improved open progress. Thanks to mvo!
 - Use sudo to run linitian as the user of the transaction
 - Several bug fixes

* General API changes:

 - Fix: Emit the properties and signals with the documentated static types.

* gtk3widgets Python module:

 - There is now a gtk3widgets module which uses GTK 3.0 and pygobject (with
   introspection). gtk3-demo.py is a corresponding port of gtk-demo.py.

* org.debian.apt.transaction D-Bus interface
 
 - The sizes in the ProgressDownload are now of type long - following the API
   changes in APT. Therefor the signature of the ProgressDownload struct
   changed to "ssxxs".


API CHANGES 0.40:

* General:

  - Checks .deb files with lintian before installing
  - Apport integration provides additional information on exceptions
  - Uses gettext domains in policy files

* org.debian.aptdaemon D-Bus interface:

 - Allow to specify the to be installed/removed version of package. The package
   name and version are separated by "=", e.g. "xterm=258-1".
   
 - API BREAK: The CommitPackage method has got a new argument to downgrade
   packages.
   You have to specify the version of the to be downgraded packages.
 
 - API BREAK: The InstallFile method now takes an additional argument force to
   allow installing package files which violate the Debian/Ubuntu policy.

 - Authentication for actions has been moved to the
   org.debian.aptdaemon.transaction.Run(). This allows to simulate actions
   without having to authenticate for it.
 
 - Add a new transaction based action Clean() which allows to remove
   cached downloaded package files.

 - Add a new transaction based action Reconfigure() which allows to reconfigure
   already installed packages using debconf.

 - Add writable property PopConParticipation to control the participation
   in the package popularity contest.
 
 - Add writable properties AutoUpdateInterval, AutoDownload, AutoCleanInterval
   and UnattendedUpgrade to control the behavior of the APT cron job.

* console client:

 - Add a --details option to show the version number of to be changed packages

 - Add --clean, --reconfigure and --priority option

* defer modules:

 - Moved to a separate project python-defer

* enums module:

 - Add ERROR_UNREADABLE_PACKAGE_FILE and ERROR_INVALID_PACKAGE_FILE to provide
   finer error messages

* client module:
 
 - The return value of wait=True in an async call is now the exit state of
   the transaction instead of the Transaction instance. It behaves now
   as documented and in the same way as sync calls.
 
 - Add AptClient.clean(), see changes in the D-Bus interface

 - Add AptClient.reconfigure(), see changes in the D-Bus interface

* PolicyKit privileges:

 - Add a new org.debian.apt.clean privilege for removing downloaded
   package files. It is granted by default to all active sessions.

 - Add org.debian.apt.change-config privilege for changing the APT
   configuration.


API CHANGES 0.33

* org.debian.apt D-Bus interface

 - Make AddRepository() and EnableDistroComponent() transaction based.

 - Add a new UpdateCachePartially() method which allows to only update
   the repositories from a given sources.list snippet.
 

* org.debian.apt.transaction D-Bus interface

 - Add a RunAfter() method to chain transactions.

 - Add an Unauthenticated property to the transaction.


* client Python module

 - Adapt to changes in the D-Bus interfaces.


* enums Python module

 - Add new role enums ROLE_ADD_REPOSITORY and ROLE_ENABLE_DISTOR_COMP.


* policykit1 Python module

 - Raise an AuthorizationFailed exception in a non-interactive check if the 
   user could obtain the privilege in interactive-mode (is_challenged)


* errors Python module

 - Make the AuthorizationFailed error an inheritance of NotAuthorizedError


* PolicyKit1:

 - Allow every active user to update the cache
 - Merge install-packages, remove-packages and fix privilege into a new 
   install-or-remove-packages one
 - Merge add- and remove-vendor-key privileges into change-repository one
 - Remove upgrade-system in favour of upgrade-packages
 - Allow set-proxy and cancel-foreign only by auth_admin


API CHANGES 0.32

* PolicyKit1:

 - Add a new privilege org.debian.apt.set-proxy which allows to set an http
   proxy server for a transaction. Currently every active user is allowed to
   set a proxy for his or her transactions.


* entry points:

 - Add modify_cache_before and modify_cache_after entry point which make
   it possible for plugins to modify the to be installed or removed packages
   of a transaction. See README.Plugins for further details.


* client Python module:

 - Allow to convert all methods into Deferreds by using the deferable_function
   decorator, see below for more details.

 - Add a downloads attribute to AptTransaction. It contains a dictionary of all
   processed downloads. The key is the uri of the download. The value is a
   tuple of status enum, short description, full size, downloaded size and a
   status/error message

 - Add a progress-download-changed signal to AptTransaction which is emitted
   when a download progress information changed, see above.

 - Implement the wait arguement in the AptClient methods which are transaction
   based. If True the transaction will be started immediately and the method
   call will return when the transaction is finished.

 - Add add_vendor_key_from_keyserver method, see AddVendorKeyFromKeyserver


* enums Python module:

 - Add a set of DOWNLOAD_* status enumerations.

 - Fix value of STATUS_DOWNLOADING: from status-downloadgin to 
   status-downloading


* defer Python module:

 - Add inline_callbacks and return_value functions which allow to write
   async code in a sync way. Works like the inlineCallbacks decorator from
   the Twisted framework.

 - Add deferable decorator which adds a defer attribute to the
   decorated function and returns a Deferred instance. The callback of the 
   Deferred will be passed as reply_handler argument and the errback as the 
   error_handler argument to the decorated function.


* gtkwidgets Python module:
 
 - Add to the AptConfirmDialog two methods which allow to override the rendered
   objects and icons: map_package and render_package_icon

 - Add AptDownloadsView class, which allows to show the sub progress of each
   download

 - Rename AptTerminalExpander to AptDetailsExpander and add a terminal
   attribute to the __init__ call, since the expander now also shows
   the download sub-progresses.

 - AptProgressWindow now sets the proxy and debconf frontend during the
   run call instead of during the set_transaction call.


* org.debian.aptdaemon.transaction D-Bus interface:

  - Add a ProgressDownload property. It contains the last download progress
    information that was recieved from APT. It is an array of uri, status enum,
    short description, full size, downloaded size and an error/status message.

  - Add AddVendorKeyFromKeyserver method to download and use a GnuPG which
    is used for authenticating packages.


API CHANGES 0.31

* client Python module:
  
  - Add AptClient.enable_distro_component method, see EnableDistroComponent

 
* org.debian.aptdaemon D-Bus interface:

  - Add EnableDistroComponent method which enables a component for all distro
    repositories, e.g. main or universe


API CHANGES 0.30

* client Python module:

  - Change order of error_handler and reply_handler in the AptTransaction.run
    method to be in sync with the other methods

  - Add the dependencies, download and space attribute and the corresponding
    *-changed signal to AptTransaction, see interface changes below

  - Add a new AptTransaction.simulate() method, see interface changes below
  
  - The AptDaemonError stored in client.AptTransaction.error was replaced by
    a errors.TransactionFailed error. The APtDaemonError has been removed
    from the client module.

  - The DBus exception will be converted to native ones which are shared
    with the daemon. E.g. The DBusException with the error name
    "org.debian.apt.TransactionRoleAlreadySet" will be a 
    TransactionRoleAlreadySet instance instead. This makes error handling
    easier since you can use try/except without having to compare the
    _dbus_error_name attributes.


* errors Python modules:

  - Rename APTDError to AptDaemonError because of readabilty

  - Add convert_dbus_exception decorator which converts DBus exception
    raised in a function to native ones. Also takes asynchrous calls
    into account.

  - Move NotAuthorizedError from policykit1 to the errors module


* enums Python module:
 
  - Use strings instead of integers for STATUS_*, EXIT_*, ROLE_* and ERROR_*
    enum. See interface changes for additional information

  - Add new enum EXIT_UNFINISHED


* org.debian.aptdaemon.transaction D-Bus interface:

  - The Exit, Status, Role and Error property and the Finished signal now
    use strings for the enums. This helps to make debugging a lot easier.

  - Add Simulate method which calculates the dependencies, the download size
    and the to be used disk space of the transaction. Furthermore it raises
    a "org.debian.aptdaemon.errors.TransactionFailed" if the transaction
    could not be performed.

    The Simulate call also takes all previously queued or currently running
    transactions into account. So you can simulate the removal a package
    if the installation of it is still in the queue.

  - Add new properties Dependencies, Download and Space, see above.


API CHANGES 0.20

You don't have to request a transaction, set it up and call the whished action
on it aynmore. Instead you call the action, e.g. UpdateCache, on the daemon
interface which will return the id of a newly created transaction. After settingit up you have to call its Run method.

* org.debian.aptdaemon D-Bus interface:

  - Add InstallPackages, InstallFile, RemovePackages, CommitPackages,
    UpgradePackages, UpgradeSystem, AddVendorKey, RemoveVendorKey, UpdateCache
    method. Each method creates a new transaction and returns its tid.

  - Remove RequestTransaction method

  - Add new FixIncompleteInstall method which basically runs dpkg --configure -a

  - Add a new FixBrokenDepends method wich tries to correct dependencies


* org.debian.aptdaemon.transaction D-Bus interface:

  - Remove InstallPackages, InstallFile, RemovePackages, CommitPackages,
    UpgradePackages, UpgradeSystem, AddVendorKey, RemoveVendorKey, UpdateCache
    method. They are now part of the org.debian.aptdaemon interface.

  - Add a Run method which queues the transaction.

  - Add PropertyChanged signal - should be used instead of the deprecated
    signals. Signal matchers are quite limited on the system bus by default.

  - Add ProgressDetails, RequiredMedium, ConfigFilePrompt, ExitState, Error,
    Locale, AllowUnauthenticated, Terminal, DebconfSocket, Packages,
    MetaData and RemoveObsoletedDepends properties.

    The Packages property keeps a lists of packages which should be installed,
    reinstalled, removed, purged or upgraded. Currently this doesn't work for
    UpgradeSystem.

    The MetaData property allows clients to store additional meta data in the
    transaction. See man page org.debian.apt.transaction(7) for the format.

  - Rename the AllowCancel property to Cancellable and the AllowTerminal one
    to TerminalAttached - helps to make a difference between allowing
    from the client and daemon side e.g. AllowUnauthenticated.

  - Remove Message signal and the concept of having non-critical fail states
    on the daemon side. The decision is up to the client e.g. if a system
    could not be fully updated.

  - Remove the Role, Status, AllowCancel, AllowTerminal, StatusDetails,
    Progress, ProgressDetails signal - PropertyChanged signal should be used
    instead.

  - Remove the Attach method - GetAll on the properties interface
    should be used instead.

  - Rename property ConfigFilePrompt to ConfigFileConflict and the method
    AnswerConfigFilePrompt to ResolveConfigFileConflict


* client Python module:

  - The exit_handler was removed from the AptDaemonClient methods, instead it
    now supports (reply|error)_handlers to call the method asynchronously and
    furthermore a wait statement to return after the method is complete.

  - Add public attributes to the Transaction class and remove get_* helpers:

    role, error (stores an AptDaemonError instance), error_code, error_message,
    exit_state, cancellable, term_attached, required_medium,
    config_file_prompt, status, status_details, progress, progress_details,
    paused, remove_obsoleted_depends

    The properties are automatically updated by the PropertyChanged signal
    matcher.
 
 - Rename GObject signals of the Transaction class:

    - role -> role-changed
    - status -> status-changed
    - allow-cancel -> cancellable-changed
    - allow-terminal -> terminal-attached-changed
    - status -> status-changed
    - status-details -> status-details-changed
    - progress -> progress-changed
    - progress-details -> progress-details-changed
    - config-file-prompt -> config-file-conflict

 - Rename method config_file_prompt_answer to resolve_config_file_conflict
 
 - Add GObject signals to the Transaction class:

    - meta-data-changed
    - paused
    - resumed
    - locale-changed
    - allow-unauthenticated-changed
    - remove-obsoleted-depends-changed
    - debconf-socket-changed
 
 - The methods Transaction.set_(locale|allow_unauthenticated|data|
   debconf_socket|remove_obsoleted_depends) reply with the transaction
   instance if called async. This makes queing much easier.
 
 - Remove messages attribute from the Transaction class, see above

 - Remove Transaction.attach method in favour of a new sync method which uses
   the GetAll method on the D-Bus properties interface.

 - Add set_meta_data method which accepts pairs of key=value


* PyGTK widgtes:

 - On the one hand the run method of AptProgressDialog doesn't provide a way
   to wait until the transaction is done anymore (by iterating on pending gtk
   events), but on the other hand it now allows to show an error dialog if
   required (show_error argument) or to close the progress window 
   automatically when the transaction is finished (close_on_finished arguement).

 - Rename AptConfigFilePromptDialog to AptConfigFileConflictDialog
